							<h2>The fastest growing sneaker company youâ€™ve never heard of</h2>
							<p>JBJRL faces growing competition from Internet-based businesses that sell similar merchandise, often at deep discounts. Many price-conscious customers visit your brick-and-mortar store, try on a pair of desirable shoes and order the footwear from the online retailer. You can address this revenue loss by forming a partnership with a supply-chain specialty firm. When a customer wants a specific shoe size, and your store does not stock that pair, the supply chain firm locates the shoes at a nearby store. Your customer purchases the shoes from that retailer, and you receive sales revenue according to your agreement with your supply chain partner.</p>
